      <h1>Neige</h1>

      <p>I'm the human of a wonderful cat called Neige.</p>

      <p>
        We met in 2011 at
        <a href="https://phs-spca.org/">Peninsula Humane Society &amp; SPCA</a>.
        She was a beautiful white kitten with a super-soft fur. It was Love at
        first sight, she moved in immediatly after our first date.

      <p>
        Neige is my first cat ever (I grew up with dogs). One of my friends who
        has kids says "I didn't know how to be a parent. It's my kid who taught
        me how to be a parent." I guess it's the same thing with cats. Neige
        taught me how to be a good cat dad.

      <h2>Neige in her cat cave</h2>
      <p>
        She is rather social, but in winter she spend a lot of time in her cat
        cave.

      <h2>Selfie with Neige</h2>

      <p>
        I tried to take a selfie with my beautiful cat... but she wouldn't stand
        still.

      </div>

      <p>She doesn't mind holding the pause when playing Batman though.</p>
