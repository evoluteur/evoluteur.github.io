      <h1>Neige</h1>

      <p>I'm the human of a wonderful cat called Neige.</p>

      <p>
        We met in 2011 at
        <a
          href="https://phs-spca.org/"
          class="extlink"
          target="phs"
          rel="noopener"
          >Peninsula Humane Society &amp; SPCA</a
        >. She was a beautiful white kitten with a super-soft fur. It was Love
        at first sight, she moved in immediatly after our first date.

      <p>
        Neige is my first cat ever (I grew up with dogs). One of my friends who
        has kids once told me "I didn't know how to be a parent. It's my kid who
        taught me." I guess it's the same thing with cats. Neige taught me how
        to be a good cat dad. I think she trained me too well, and she may be a
        little spoiled.

      <h2>Neige in her cat cave</h2>
      <p>
        She is rather social, but in winter she spends a lot of time in her cat
        cave.

      <h2>Selfie with Neige</h2>

      <p>
        I tried to take a selfie with my beautiful cat... but she wouldn't stand
        still.

      </div>

      <p>She doesn't mind holding the pause when playing Batman though.</p>

      <h2>No travel allowed</h2>

      <p>
        She really doesn't like me leaving home. Every time I pack my suitcase
        for a trip, she makes sure to be in the way and camps on my suitcase all
        day.
