This is the Home Page of Olivier Giulieri.

It includes a (non exhaustive) list of things I like: My cat Neige, UI Code, Fractals, French dessert recipes, French sci-fi graphic novels, Sci-fi movies, Art, Book carvings, Meditation, Handpan...

I hope it will provide a more fun and personal way to meet me than my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
